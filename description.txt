    Just another mod that adds some stuff that i think would be cool. Also my first mod.

    Includes a handful of items, some of them dont have a way to be obtained yet, so maybe just activate some Cheat mod and try them out.
    
    Currently also adds some hybrid set bonuses:
    (Ranged)
        Necro + Fossil 
        Cobalt + Palladium + Frost
        Orichalcum + Mythril + Frost
        Titanium + Adamantite + Frost
        Hallowed + Chlorophyte
        
    (Melee)
        Cobalt + Palladium + Frost
        Orichalcum + Mythril + Frost
        Titanium + Adamantite + Frost
        Hallowed + Chlorophyte

    For the frost armor sets combinations, you cant get the hybrid set bonus with *only* the frost helmet since its 2 classes.
    Also needs atleast 1 frost armor piece to get the hybrid set bonus.
    Please let me know any bugs or feedback!
