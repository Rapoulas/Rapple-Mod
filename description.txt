    Just another mod that adds some stuff that i think would be cool. Also my first mod.

    Includes a handful of items, some of them dont have a way to be obtained yet, so maybe just activate some Cheat mod and try them out.
    
    Currently also adds some hybrid set bonuses:
    (Ranged)
        Necro + Fossil 
        Cobalt + Palladium + Frost
        Orichalcum + Mythril + Frost
        Titanium + Adamantite + Frost
        Hallowed + Chlorophyte
        
    (Melee)
        Cobalt + Palladium + Frost
        Orichalcum + Mythril + Frost
        Titanium + Adamantite + Frost
        Hallowed + Chlorophyte

    For the frost armor sets combinations, you cant get the hybrid set bonus with *only* the frost helmet since its 2 classes.
    Also needs atleast 1 frost armor piece to get the hybrid set bonus.

    Currently most weapons are craftable (im bad at having ideas on drop locations lmao if you have any just let me know :D )

    Weapon drop locations:
    Bonetrousle 20% drop chance from Skeletron's lootbag (Expert only)
    Linoge 20% drop chance from Golem's lootbag (Expert only)
    Dark Army 20% drop chance from Plantera

    Please let me know any bugs or feedback!
